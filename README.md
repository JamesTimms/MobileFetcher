# electron-quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to see an Electron in action.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `index.html` - A web page to render.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML.
- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.

To run the application once setup run...
```bash
$ npm start
# or
$ electron .
```

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).

$ npm install && npm start
# Then compile the frontend.
